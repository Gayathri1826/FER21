# Face Emotion Recognition

## Getting Started
### Abstract
Human emotion recognition plays an important role in interpersonal relationships. The automatic recognition of emotions has been an active research topic from early eras. Therefore, there are several advances made in this field. Hence extracting and understanding of emotion has a high importance of the interaction between human and machine communication. The main objective of the project is to propose real time implementation of emotion recognition systems and classify the emotion on a person's face, using deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It uses deep-learning technology to generate models with emotion-based facial expressions to recognize emotions. A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model can be trained to analyze images and identify face emotion.
